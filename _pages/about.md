{::nomarkdown}<center><h1><q>Every mystery can be explained,<br>with the right materials and tools.</q></h1></center>{:/}

My principle research interests lie in the field of data analysis and mining, probabilistic and statistical modeling as well as similar prediction and convex optimization techniques for creating real world application such as recommendation systems.

I also am interested in using new approaches, techniques, and technologies such as big data, deep learning, stream data, online learning, and trend analysis to expand existed knowledge and support people life.

## Education

{::nomarkdown}<center>2012/10 〜</center>{:/} | **PhD. Student**<br>[Department of Informatics, School of Multidisciplinary Sciences, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Japan.](http://www.nii.ac.jp/graduate/en/)<br>{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>5-year PhD international course with granted scholarship from National Institute of Informatics (NII), which covers admission fee, tuition fee, and monthly allowance.</li><li><b>Latent Models for Movie Recommendation System</b> -- PhD. dissertation progress (equivalent to Master’s thesis)<br>I extended proposed Bayesian probabilistic model, with an assumption the movies popularity is as decreased as they are getting older. The model is able to group up the same characteristics such as rating patterns by their age. It also shows that not all movies go along with the stated assumption. The prediction accuracy is also improved by a help from support vector regression as in previous work</li></ul>{:/}
