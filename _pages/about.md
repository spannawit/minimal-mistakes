<h1>Knowledge (Data) is Power</h1>

My principle research interests lie in the field of data analysis and mining, probabilistic and statistical modeling as well as similar prediction and convex optimization techniques for creating real world application such as recommendation systems.

I also am interested in using new approaches, techniques, and technologies such as big data, deep learning, stream data, online learning, and trend analysis to expand existed knowledge and support people life.
